    `The first time i wrote a program when i entered college. My
    very first language is python and i was so confused on what to
    write, so i kinda hate it at first. But then, one day, my
    friend had an assignment which is like a puzzle and since i
    liked the problem i tried to solve it.`,
    `The problem was N-Queen problem, where you tried to put 8
    queen on a chess board and make sure that each queen does not
    attack each other. I tried to create the program using python
    and i was so invested on it that i spent 2 days trying to
    solve it. I solved it and this is where my interest of
    programming started.`,
    `Later on, i found out that there are a lot of things that you
    can do with programming, such as web development, AI, Software
    Engineer, and many more! Right now, i'm trying to be a
    fullstack software engineer, so there are still a lot of
    things i should learn 📚.`],
