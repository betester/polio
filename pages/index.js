                Hello there! I'm Ikramullah, you can call me ikram. I was born
                in 4th of July 2002, which is the independence day of America.
                Though, i was born in Indonesia, Banda Aceh ,the most western
                part of Indonesia. I grew up there until 20 years old and moved
                to Depok for my education.

                I am currently studying in Universitas Indonesia, taking
                Computer Science degree. I actually have no programming
                experience, i chose Computer science just because. Turns out, i
                really enjoyed it and now i'm at my 2nd year.

                The first time i wrote a program when i entered college. My very
                first language is python and i was so confused on what to write,
                so i kinda hate it at first. But then, one day, my friend had an
                assignment which is like a puzzle and since i liked the problem
                i tried to solve it.

                The problem was N-Queen problem, where you tried to put 8 queen
                on a chess board and make sure that each queen does not attack
                each other. I tried to create the program using python and i was
                so invested on it that i spent 2 days trying to solve it. I
                solved it and this is where my interest of programming started (
                thank you N-Queen ).

                Later on, i found out that there are a lot of things that you
                can do with programming, such as web development, AI, Software
                Engineer, and many more! Right now, i'm trying to be a fullstack
                software engineer, so there are still a lot of things i should learn üìö.
